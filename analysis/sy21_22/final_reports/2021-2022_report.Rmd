#### 2021-2022 End of Year Report

### Background

To date (`r Sys.Date() %>% format("%b %d, %Y")`), Teaching Lab has
administered the following to participants from your school or district
during SY21-22:

-   `r format(nrow(session_survey), big.mark = ",")` complete responses to the End of Session
    Surveys that gather participant feedback on facilitation from
    session to session;

-   `r format(nrow(course_survey), big.mark = ",")` complete responses to the End of Course
    Surveys that gather participant feedback on each PL course;

-   `r pre_know` complete responses to the first Knowledge or
    Self-Reported Practices Assessments and `r post_know` to the second
    Knowledge or Self-Reported Practices Assessments;

-   `r format(diagnostic_count, big.mark = ",")` complete responses to the Baseline Diagnostic
    Educator Survey and `r follow_educator_count` to the Follow-up Educator Survey that collects information on teachers' use of
    curricula, mindsets, self-reported practices, and school
    environment.

Below are the results presented in various sections: Participant Background and Demographics Summary, Participant Perceptions, Participant Knowledge, Teachers’ Mindsets & School Environment, Administrators’ Mindsets & Observational Practices, Instructional Practice, and Student Outcomes.

-   `r demonstrated_agree[2]` strongly agree or agree that the facilitators
    demonstrated deep knowledge of the content they facilitated.

Here, by visualizing ratings of strongly agree/agree in blue areas, and
all other ratings in black areas we visualize feedback over time (If
there is just one point of feedback this appears as a dot).

In summary, we see the following % agree or strongly agree with the
above statements:

-   `r quality_agree[2]` strongly agree or agree that they were satisfied with the overall quality of the course.
-   `r facilitated_agree[2]` strongly agree or agree that they were satisfied with how the course was facilitated.
-   `r community_agree[2]` strongly agree or agree that they felt a sense of community with the other participants in the course.

-   `r supported_agree[2]` strongly agree or agree that the course has supported me in being responsive to students’ backgrounds, cultures, and points of view.

Here, by visualizing ratings of strongly agree/agree in blue areas, and all other ratings in black areas we visualize feedback over time (If there is just one point of feedback this appears as a dot).

ability to engage in culturally responsive and sustaining education
(CRSE) practices on a scale from 0 (not at all confident) to 10

# Section 5: Administrators’ Mindsets & Observational Practices

Teaching Lab administers a Diagnostic Educator Survey in the fall and a Follow-up Educator Survey in the spring. The results are below.

Administrators responded to items about the recognition of race and culture and holding high expectations for all students.

# Section 7: Student Outcomes

Teachers administered a student survey to at least one of their groups.
Using 5-point Likert-type scales, students responded to eight items
related to their teachers' engagement in CRSE practices, three items
related to teacher-student relationships, five items about
self-efficacy, six items about happiness and sense of belonging, and
five items about being challenged. Responses were averaged across items.
Higher scores correspond to more positive experiences.
