\section{Likert Ratings}

From August 1 to August 31 there were `r n` responses given by Open Enrollment Bootcamp participants, they largely gave positive feedback when asked questions about a variety of ways to assess the effectiveness of the facilitation of their courses.

\subsection{Percent Agree and Strongly Agree}




In summary, we see the following % agree or strongly agree with the above statements:


- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "This course has supported\nme in being responsive\nto students' backgrounds,\ncultures, and points of view." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that the course has supported me in being responsive to students' backgrounds, cultures, and points of view.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "The strategies I’ve learned\nin this course will improve my\ninstruction." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they've learned in this course will improve my instruction.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "The strategies I’ve learned\nin this course will improve\nmy coaching or supervision of\nteachers." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they facilitated the content clearly.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "The strategies I’ve learned\nin the course are easy to\nimplement." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that the strategies I’ve learned in the course are easy to implement.

- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "I am satisfied with how the\ncourse was facilitated." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they were satisfied with how the course was facilitated.


\section{Over Time}



In this section responses are illustrated on a daily basis, in this case all reviews were submitted on the same day.

\section{Qualitative Participant Feedback}

Finally responses to the following questions are presented below:

- What could have been better about today's session?

- What went well in today's session?

- What additional feedback do you have about their facilitation skills?

\subsection{Overall, what went well in the course?}
