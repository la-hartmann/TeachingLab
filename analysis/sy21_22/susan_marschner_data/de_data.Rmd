\section{Likert Ratings}

There have been `r n` responses given by Delaware Department of Education, DE participants, they largely gave positive feedback when asked questions about a variety of ways to assess the effectiveness of the facilitation of their courses.
```{r}

          "How much do you agree with the following statements about this course? - The independent online work activities were well-designed to help me meet the learning targets.",
          "How much do you agree with the following statements about this course? - I felt a sense of community with the other participants in this course. even though we were meeting virtually.",
          "How much do you agree with the following statements about this course? - The strategies I’ve learned in this course will improve my instruction.",
          "How much do you agree with the following statements about this course? - The strategies I’ve learned in this course will improve my coaching or supervision of teachers.",
          "How much do you agree with the following statements about this course? - The strategies I’ve learned in the course are easy to implement.",
          "How much do you agree with the following statements about this course? - I will apply what I have learned in this course to my practice in the next 4-6 weeks.",

\subsection{Percent Agree and Strongly Agree}




In summary, we see the following % agree or strongly agree with the above statements:


- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "This course has supported\nme in being responsive\nto students' backgrounds,\ncultures, and points of view." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that the course has supported me in being responsive to students' backgrounds, cultures, and points of view.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "The strategies I’ve learned\nin this course will improve my\ninstruction." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they've learned in this course will improve my instruction.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "The strategies I’ve learned\nin this course will improve\nmy coaching or supervision of\nteachers." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they facilitated the content clearly.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "The strategies I’ve learned\nin the course are easy to\nimplement." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that the strategies I’ve learned in the course are easy to implement.

\section{Qualitative Participant Feedback}

Finally responses to the following questions are presented below:

- What could have been better about today's session?

- What went well in today's session?

- What additional feedback do you have about their facilitation skills?

\subsection{Overall, what went well in the course?}

```{r include = F}
