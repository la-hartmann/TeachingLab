\section{Likert Ratings}

From August 1 to August 31 there were `r n` responses given by San Diego Unified School District participants, they largely gave positive feedback when asked questions about a variety of ways to assess the effectiveness of the facilitation of their courses.




```{r}

        )
```



\subsection{Percent Agree and Strongly Agree}




In summary, we see the following % agree or strongly agree with the above statements:

- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "They were fully prepared for\nthe session." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they were fully prepared for the session.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "They responded to the group’s\nneeds." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they responded to the group's needs.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "They facilitated the content\nclearly." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they facilitated the content clearly.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "They effectively built a safe\nlearning community." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they effectively built a safe learning community.
- `r plot_agree %>% filter(Question == "They demonstrated deep\nknowledge of the content they\nfacilitated." & Response %in% c("(4) Agree", "(5) Strongly agree")) %>% summarise(Percent = sum(Percent)) %>% pull(Percent) %>% round() %>% paste0(., "%")` strongly agree or agree that they demonstrated deep knowledge of the content they facilitated.

\section{Qualitative Participant Feedback}

Finally responses to the following questions are presented below:

- What could have been better about today's session?

- What went well in today's session?

- What additional feedback do you have about their facilitation skills?
