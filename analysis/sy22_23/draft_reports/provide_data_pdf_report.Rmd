\subsection{Percent Agree and Strongly Agree}




In summary, we see the following % agree or strongly agree with the above statements:


- `r fully_prepared` strongly agree or agree that the facilitators were fully prepared for the session.
- `r responded_needs` strongly agree or agree that the facilitators responded to the group’s needs.
- `r facilitated_clearly` strongly agree or agree that the facilitators facilitated the content clearly.
- `r effectively_built` strongly agree or agree that the facilitators effectively built a safe learning community.
- `r demonstrated_knowledge` strongly agree or agree that the facilitators demonstrated deep knowledge of the content they facilitated.


\section{Qualitative End of Session Participant Feedback}

Finally responses to the following questions are presented below:

- What is one thing from today's learning that you plan to take back to your classroom?

- What went well in today's session?

- What could have been better about today’s session?

- Any additional feedback

\subsection{What is one thing from today's learning that you plan to take back to your classroom?}

```{r echo = F}

    )
} else {
  no_data_plot
}
```

```{r }

\subsection{What went well in today's session?}

```{r echo = F}

\subsection{What is the learning from this course that you are most excited about trying out?}

```{r include = F}

\subsection{Any additional feedback}

```{r include = F}
