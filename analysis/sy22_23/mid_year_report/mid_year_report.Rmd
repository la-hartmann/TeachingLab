### Background

Teaching Lab collects a variety of data to understand the impact of its
PL for educators and students. Please see this
[resource](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vo844M0_Au8bqfeK5-hPdFh30oGRjzjCxwm6vctemQ8/edit#slide=id.g1165a219667_0_182)
for a visual overview of our evaluation framework. Additionally, the
[narrative
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yDyFCx1KeSPHlD9SLvLfG76FRGdfChL1hnCo_dV1zQ/edit) of
our evaluation plan provides more details.

To date (`r Sys.Date() |> format("%b %d, %Y")`), Â Teaching Lab has
collected the following data during SY22-23:

-   `r format(nrow(session_survey), big.mark = ",")` complete responses
    to the End of Session Survey section of the survey that gathers
    participant feedback on facilitation from session to session;

-   `r format(nrow(course_survey), big.mark = ",")` complete responses
    to the End of Course Survey section of the survey that gathers
    participant feedback on each PL course;

-   `r format(nrow(ongoing_coaching), big.mark = ",")` complete
    responses to the Ongoing Coaching section of the survey that gathers
    participant feedback on each Coaching session;

-   `r format(nrow(end_coaching), big.mark = ",")` complete responses to
    the End of Coaching section of the survey that gathers participant
    feedback on each Coaching performance;

-   `r pre_know` complete responses to the first Knowledge or
    Self-Reported Practices Assessments and `r post_know` to the second
    Knowledge or Self-Reported Practices Assessments;

-   `r format(diagnostic_count, big.mark = ",")` complete responses to
    the Baseline Diagnostic Educator Survey that collects information on
    teachers' use of curricula, mindsets, self-reported practices, and
    school environment.

Below we have compiled the results in various sections: Participant
Background and Demographics Summary, Participant Perceptions,
Participant Knowledge, Teachers\' Mindsets & School Environment, School
Leaders\' Mindsets & Observational Practices, Instructional Practice,
and Student Outcomes.

# Section 2: Participant Perceptions

This section summarizes participants\' feedback on Teaching Lab PL.

-   The End of Session survey is collected at the end of each PL course
    (except the last session) and is focused on feedback for the
    facilitators.

-   The End of Course survey is collected at the end of the last session
    of a PL course and focuses on feedback for the entire course.

-   The Ongoing Coaching Feedback Survey is periodically administered to
    teachers receiving coaching support to provide feedback on coaches.

-   The End of Coaching Feedback Survey is administered at the end of
    coaching support and provides feedback on the entire coaching
    experience.

Results are presented in the aggregate and then by each content area.

# Section 4: Teachers' Mindsets & School Environment

Participants complete Teaching Labâs Educator Survey twice a year: at the beginning and end of their participation in PL. The survey collects data on teachersâ mindsets, perception and use of curricula, and perceptions of school culture and climate. 

## Section 4a: Teacher - Mindsets

Teachers responded to several items about mindsets, related to recognizing race and culture, the need for remediation, high expectations for all students, and growth mindsets on a 5-point Likert scale. Composite measures were created for each construct by reverse coding some items and then averaging responses across items. In this way, higher scores correspond to holding equitable mindsets.

# Section 5: School Leaders' Mindsets & Observational Practices

Participants complete Teaching Labâs Educator Survey twice a year: at the beginning and end of their participation in PL. The survey collects data on school leadersâ mindsets and self-reported observational practices.

## Section 5a: School Leaders - Mindsets

School leaders responded to several items about mindsets, related to recognizing race and culture, the need for remediation, high expectations for all students, and growth mindsets on a 5-point Likert scale. Composite measures were created for each construct by reverse coding some items and then averaging responses across items. In this way, higher scores correspond to holding equitable mindsets.

## Section 6b: Classroom Observations

Teaching Lab has the opportunity to observe some participants over the course of their participation in PL. Below are the results of the initial classroom observations conducted using the IPG Math and ELA Tools, in addition to the FSOT.  Ratings of 3 and 4 on 4-point Likert scales and Yes on a Yes/No items were considered positive.

# Section 7: Student Outcomes

Some teachers will administer a student survey to at least one of their groups. Using 5-point Likert-type scales, students will respond to items related to their teachersâ engagement in CRSE practices, teacher-student relationships, self-efficacy, happiness and sense of belonging, and being challenged. No data yet, but soon to come!
