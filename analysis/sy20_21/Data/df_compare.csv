I want my scholars to be able to see positive behaviors and learn how to interact with their peers and myself in a respectful manner. Seeing a positive atmosphere as you are entering a space is vital to the outcome of anything that is a product of that space. As they enter the classroom, be it virtually or traditional, I want to foster positive affirmations, social/emotional checks and activities that help us grow and learn from one another. I want them to hear each other positively narrating every interaction. Exchanging kind words coupled with action is monumental in building relationships. I want them to feel wanted. Feel loved. Feel heard. I know it won't be perfect, but I want it to be a perfect and comfortable space for growth., When I think about my ideal image of a learning environment, I think about student voice.  Every student should feel empowered, respected, and heard.  In an ideal classroom, students are challenged  academically and encouraged to take risks.  They collaborate with their peers and receive corrective feedback from their teachers.  In this environment, we would observe students working cooperatively and having meaningful discussions.  We would also see the classroom teacher working with small groups of students and differentiating instruction to meet the needs of everyone. 

In this ideal setting, the classroom teacher will challenge students and allow them to engage in productive struggle.   Teachers would acknowledge the potential, abilities, and gifts that every child has, and support and encourage them. Every student would feel valued, encouraged and motivated to achieve.

Most groups are working on the same *set* of problems, but not all necessarily the same problems from those sets.

Sometimes groups get stuck, and call over the teacher, seeking support and insight. The teacher starts just by listening to what the students have tried so far, what their current questions and challenges are. With just a handful of clarifying questions, over the course of their conversation with the teacher, those students have a clearer understanding of where they are, and what directions they can go, in search of progress. Sometimes, the teacher sends a group member to another group, to ask some relevant questions.

As we near the end of the class, the groups pause in their work. Some take pictures of their groups' whiteboards, in order to better remember where they left off for tomorrow. Groups have all made different levels of progress, but we walk around the room, looking at different groups' work. There are a few big ideas, key insights, and powerful strategies that the teacher wants to surface before we end things for the day.

Some groups present their work, with their classmates asking clarifying questions as needed. The teacher occasionally contributes as well, drawing further attention to the important stuff.

pre_comments,"NA, Thank you!, Thank you-nothing right now, lol, I would be interested in using Guidebooks in an engaging way in the traditional classroom and distance-learning setting.  I would also like help with differentiation for diverse learners (students with disabilities and advanced learners), Ok, None, Super excited about this partnership!, I am a first year teacher and haven’t had the chance to get to know my coworkers due to corona, so some of my answers are a reflection of that and not of the school community., I am a new employee, so I haven't had the chance to build relationships and meet my coworkers in person which is indicative in some of my responses, na, none at this time, None at the moment ty, After the up coming workshops I hope to better understand the labs., None for now - Thank you!, N/A, None at this time., None. Thank You., OK., Some of the answer choices were written as absolutes. It was unclear if they were starting points or they were the only thing that would happen. That made it difficult for me to decide on the answer to choose., No questions, I did not feel like the diagnostic applied to me because I am a new teacher and this upcoming school year will be my first year teaching., No questions at this time., Will I be privy to my diagnostic results indicating my shortcomings in an area?, n/a, I will, thank you., Not at this time, ok, I do not at this time, This was an intense survey.  Many of the responses were vague.  For example, when discussing texts, the questions/responses were not specific.  Reading an excerpt versus reading a novel may allow teachers to implement varied teaching strategies.  In addition, some of the questions did not take into consideration the student population.  Teaching in an inclusive setting allows for the teachers to engage in varied teaching styles and therefore allowing wiggle room for teaching strategies.  The ""process"" may be different but the intended ""end results"" are attained., The first likert scale questions on this survey were trying to establish educators views on race and ethnicity when looking at our students. There is so much to discuss surrounding race and ethnicity that trying to gauge educators perspectives with so few questions will not give you the information you seek. Especially when one of those questions is through a “color blind” lens. This term has so much ambiguity that I am unsure about what each number on the scale would say about my ideals.   Also one of your questions has (correct) at the end of it signifying which answer is correct., One of the question items on one of the earlier pages has ""(correct)"" appended to one of the multiple choice options...which seems like it maybe shouldn't be there?, The only comment was describing my location in the beginning of the survey, my school was not there. NYC District 11 p.s. 83, therefore, I click central office., No questions at this time, I will., I am the SPED teacher for Inclusion. I am not a math content teacher., Looking forward to working on the work!, Will I get to see the answers, N/a",matheff2,"NA, What’s the first step?, Why did you do that?, I'm not sure, How did you know what to do next?, Can you draw a picture to show me what you mean?"

Although we were provided with district level PD, it was a lot to grasp because of remote learning and all the other factors this year. I am glad that I opted to participate in these sessions because it was a smaller group and included other teachers who wanted to engage and learn too., It was helpful to look at EL module and units to familiarize myself with the content and student expectations., I gained an understanding of the shifts and importance of unpacking prior to planning., A better understabding of the teacher shifts needed to provide excellent instruction and tools to work with teachers on this., Build knowledge through content- rich nonfiction.  Practice regularly with complex text and its academic language., I was able to deepen my craft, while helping others on my team as we learned new skills with virtual learning., I liked the idea of connecting students learning and community., I gained how to navigate the EL curriculum., Insight into equitable instruction, My learning was connected to Foundational Skills Block.

When acquiring the Math Specialist position, there was no formal training, we just get thrown into the position, therefore, Content Leader helped to fill that gap., Skills to examine my instructional practice as it relates to equity and eliciting student thinking, I was moved from 1st to 3rd grade due to upper grade experience.

It helped provide strategies and resources and best practices when coaching another teacher.  I really appreciated the connections that were made throughout the PD series focused on posing purposeful questions, eliciting student thinking and making math visible.  The IPG tool was introduced to use for coaching and we practiced using it through video and then with our teachers."
NA,NA,post_improvequal,"NA, I would like to learn more about pacing, and digging through all the material to find what is really needed., Not sure., Most of the time, the modules for the week opened up one day before the meeting.  It would be beneficial, if the modules opened up at least 5 days before the meetings so we would have time to complete the pre-work and be more engaged with the learning of the module., None, I felt the website where assignments were posted was hard to follow and confusing at times., The pace in which the math skills are taught., Better communication at the beginning to understand what we were going to do., More hands on activities or just working through the curriculum through a student perspective., I would have liked more opportunity to create lessons and focus on how to access materials in the EL Curriculum, nothing, I thought the experiences were meaningful.  We made the best of the remote learning situation., Everyone should be on the same page. More prepared prior to meetings to have materials we are discussing., Nothing. I enjoyed this class., I would like to have had more instruction in the skills block., It would have been great if this was a whole day face to face or virtual training. Sometimes between sessions I would forget what we previously talked about., There were no opportunities built into my school's PD structure to allow the teachers in my team to work together as a content team. As such, the PD we received in Learning Lab had little opportunity to become a part of our practice, both as a team, and individually., none, Much of the learning this year was the same as last year., I think maybe that ability to watch a lesson and be able to give feedback so that we can see this IM curriculum being taught. I felt like it was more of a methods course that I took in college., I think I would have liked to observe more videos/lessons on how to implement the programs with lower grade levels., I think I could have used more examples of how to use questioning in lower grades., I would have liked to have it done at a slower pace so that I could have a deeper understanding of what was taught in each module., I would prefer a different program, I am unsure., More time, I'm sure it's just me... but sometimes I felt overwhelmed by all the links and multiple documents etc., The Moodle website was confusing and difficult to navigate.  The assignments were long and self-taught. I think we needed to unpack a grade specific lesson/unit to be prepared for the next school year.  I would have liked to have had the hard copy of the teacher manuel and the corresponding materials during the professional learning., I'm not sure what could be improved. The asynchronous work and synchronous work was ideal for the virtual PDs. All of the knowledge we received from Dr. Soto could immediately be applied and taken back to the classroom and utilized in PLCs., This was extremely helpful., The sight was not user friendly and the site was difficult to navigate. I found that the assignments were to long and self taught.  I found Moodle to be confusing.  Also more modeling of material., I enjoyed all sessions and took away lots that I implemented, Great PD sessions., I think we needed more time to process some of the information given during our meetings.  Some of the days felt rushed and I didn't get to internalize some of the things we covered., wasn't content specific enough or driven by data specific to our individual classes, Flexibility in the plan - Adjust if we need to talk about other things, The professional development was a little scattered.  More time looking at the EL materials and modules would have been beneficial., The content could have been better organized. There was a lot of confusion in Moodle with due dates and not having permission to access materials. I felt that I was rushed in completing the session work due to this. The facilitator did not model or guide as much as I would have liked., I wish we had a bank of video resources that are strong examples for each of the areas that we worked on this year. This would provide further help in working with teachers to develop their practice., Organization., I wish I had more guidance on what steps I could do to better coach my teachers (when to observe/how to collaborate with other coaches in other departments), Less homework to do and more interactive with instructors., We could have used the proper curriculum materials with the appropriate grade teams., More practice and reflection of our own work with students, The facilator for our first inquiry cycle was excellent at presentng material and connecting with her audience virtually.  The facilitor for the second inquiry cycle was less effective with our district (this inquiry cycle was also virtual)., I enjoyed meeting with the Teaching lab this year.  I found that it was very helpful to the teachers. I would want to see the lab come in person and allow for the teachers to see  an array of different grade levels being taught by the professionals to show us what it would look like., Meet more often?, In-person, Nothing., I felt that it was a methods class from my undergrad work.  I needed specific IM training, for example watching a lesson taught and given the opportunity to reflect and give feedback., NA, One of our Facilitator's struggled with our PL.  During our Zoom, this person simply read from a script while speaking to the staff. I would have improved these sessions., Could have had  more practical examples to offer., more coaching on my planning and teaching practicies, I was happy to do the 2nd course where I could implement my learning in the classroom.  The first course did not have an opportunity for real-life implementation., More time to collaborate with other teachers with the same struggles., I just wished the dates were rolled out to us sooner.  Many teachers didn't know about this program., If we had the opportunity to take it earlier in the year., Loved the experience and wanted to be able to provide more professional learning support from the content I learned.  The timing of the training (during a pandemic) made it a challenge since teachers had a huge technology gap that needed support  to learn how to navigate hybrid and distance learning at the same time.  I wish I could have had the training during a normal year and not have had to wait to implement and share some of the great resources., Clearer expectations on the actions items between sessions and what documents to submit/upload., I should have started earlier in the year, but this year was far from ordinary., Maybe more time, there was so much going on this year in addition to the new curriculum, It was a bit confusing what needed to be handed in and in what way., N/A It would have been beneficial to receive better training on the curriculum from the district. The PD that I received from the district was not very helpful with using the curriculum appropriately., Fewer sessions, I believe when Eureka is embedded with equitable practices it is more effective and useful in my teaching practices., Too many tabs having to be opened at once, we were constantly flipping back and forth between things. Moodle was unhelpful. Typically the lessons that were taught were ones that we had already taught so it didn't help us at all. Overall, every training we had was very disorganized and more of a headache than helpful., The professional learning experience was great.  One area for improvement could've been to provide more individual feedback to the teachers in the course., would like to have seen flow of day how it looks in the classroom while teaching, I Thoroughly enjoyed BOTH of my Eureka Boot Camp and Cohort learning experiences and feel that I have a stronger ability to proceed with the work that I need to do to help my students be successful learners., More specifics about my grade-level program., Easier layout in Moodle of documents and information, Classes earlier in the year, Opportunity to unpack a module in my specific grade level., I am new. I've only been able to attend 2 sessions!, I enjoyed the overall process.  I don't think I could have improved it., More direct instruction and less collab time, A little slower it seemed rushed, Seeing and discussing more strategies to use in the classroom., Nothing, Explaining what exactly  has to be turned in and how., How the information is shared...moodle is difficult to use at times., I would have liked if the Teaching Lab could have unpacked my specific grade level module for one unit in order to understand how one full unit is conducted within the classsroom., It was too condensed over two weeks. I felt like there was way too much self-teaching and self-learning on our own time., if it was shorter, Better modeling instead of figure it out on your own approach.  Specific instructions abouyt next steps., Organization of materials., Organization, we should of worked on the curriculum for our grade level, unpacking the units in each grade and see how to plan an implement a lesson in a specific grade, I felt that the website was not user friendly at all.  I would have liked to see more modeling of the material, especially for a kindergarten classroom.  I felt that the assignments were not beneficial in helping me learn the curriculum., Communication, our school was unaware of all the coursework that went into training. This should have been clarified at the first meeting. Time was wasted going over what was our reason for becoming a teacher., The zoom sessions may have been able to be condensed, The only bummer was that I couldn't practice or employ all the things I was learning due to Covid and remote instruction.  Teachers were already under a huge amount of pressure, which made it difficult to engage them.  I was able to get some engagement, but when things get back to normal, this information will help guide me, as I get more teacher engagement., No suggestions. I found it well-organized, -, Nothing that I can remember., N/A, It would have been in person., More consistent learning throughout the school year., n/a, More time throughout the academic year and maybe 2 times each month, Looking deeper into students' needs and providing constructive feedback, I wish it would’ve been presented to teachers in a way that specified the asynchronous aspect of the course., More time to collaborate with others across our parish, not just at the school level., The Moodle platform was not user friendly, Nothing really on the end of the Teaching Lab.  It was just challenging being able to meet  with and observe a teacher throughout the year due to COVID restrictions., It was all good., I would have appreciated being with other districts., More discussion on how to work with students asynchronously, To have unpacked my grade module for one unit. This would allow for me to see how to plan accordingly for upcoming lessons., I could have used these classes much earlier in the school year., Not sure, I enjoyed what I learned., Focus more on Eureka and how to teach it, Honestly, I wish I would have waited to do the Leadership Lab for a different year.  This year has been a struggle and trying to balance the demands of the leadership lab became a bit too much.  There wasn't enough time between meeting dates to reflect what was learned, consult with teacher to plan a lesson, observe lesson and then meet for a reflection.  The content in the PD was great, just the timing was rough."
NA,NA,post_comments,"NA, I appreciate the bonding Nadalee provided for our team., I have thoroughly enjoyed our Steering Committee Meetings with Sarah Tierney; virtual walkthroughs for administrators have proven to be beneficial as well, N/a, Tough to do work outside of class.  Sometimes too much time between sessions-lose the momentum, N/A, I enjoyed this professional learning opportunity.  I am hoping that the Math instruction continues because it is making me a stronger teacher., Each Teaching Lab was well done., Jalinda did a great job and is very kind., This year, most of the Learning Lab PD was scheduled at the same time as other obligations we had (school-based PD, office hours, lunch, etc.) As such, this created multiple scheduling conflicts throughout the year, as we were double-booked., none, All of the trainers were helpful and positive when offering feedback., Each session seemed very similar and it seemed repetitive to me each session., n/, Please slow down PD so that people can digest their learning., We are overthinking education, NONE, I had a difficult time learning in this manner. It did not feel organized., Thank you., The instructors were awesome, extremely helpful and knowledgeable., I did not feel that there was a flow to what we were learning.  I felt like it was very unorganized which made it more difficult to learn., Very useful-I beleive many new teachers would benefit, Although this was not the best experience, I have heard wonderful things about teaching labs and look forward to engaging in the future., It was intensive, but great information. Are there any other tools/resources that you would suggest for working with teachers?, None, great format, Mandi was great! Really enjoyed and learned a lot during our sessions., None., Each session was not unique enough... it felt like I was very repetitive., NA, This was a great learning experience it allowed us to learn not just from the facilitator but from each other too., I really learned a lot.  I have a better understanding of equity in the classroom and how to support students with unfinished learning.  I thought Carla and Meghan were absolutely fabulous instructors.  I learned a lot from them and appreciate their respecting our time.  It was great to be able to talk with other CMSD teachers and learn new strategies that have worked well for them.  This was a difficult year with remote learning and I learned quite a bit from my peers.  It is nice to participate in such a positive professional learning community.   I also feel that this material will help me justify my teaching decisions within the TDES framework., I loved the resources and videos that were shared and the opportunity collaboration with others, I appreciated the time to work with colleagues throughout the state., This was a great experience. I really enjoyed how everyone worked together and we did a lot of discussion and collaboration with other teachers within our district., I wouldn't reccommend this to any other school, The content was useful and directly applicable to our instruction. The Teaching Lab staff actively engaged and supported our learning throughout the course.  I was very pleased with this experience., All of the Professional Educators that I worked with with Teaching Lab have been EXCELLENT and very dedicated to working with us to improve our skill and how we/I work with my students. (Nick Satyal, Mary Shaw-Lewis, and Elizabeth/Liz Van Hoesen)., Katie has been such a wonderful thought partner and comforting presenter. This was a tough year, but every session was worthwhile and rich., Callie and Kristen were great!, More consistency, I am new. I've only been able to attend 2 sessions!, Instructors were great and very patient!! Thank You!, Katie is a wonderful instructor, It was a great year,, I also felt like some of the links did not apply to our school. For example, when I clicked on Learn Zillion I had to create an account, only to find out it required a paid subscription. Furthermore our school does not use it. That was quite confusing. 
In addition, I'm not sure that my colleagues felt comfortable posting to a Forum where everyone could read their responses/homework., Everything felt very unorganized to me, which made it very difficult to learn., Lindsey Romano was excellent in making the content easy to understand but allowing us work time to grapple with the coaching concepts and best teaching practices., I found this an extremely valuable professional development experience to help improve my classroom instruction and impact on ALL students., I truly enjoyed our instructors teaching and the discussions I was able to have with other educators., Thank you! It has truly been some of the best professional development I have been a part of since moving to this district., Awesome work, This is a great learning opportunity for all teachers., great professional learning, I very much enjoyed the different inquiry cycles we went through as a group.  Just wish we were in person in the schools to be able to implement some of the concepts more effectively.  Teachers has so many extra stresses placed on them, I didn't want to be the one to add to them this year., I have no further comment at this time., I enjoyed all of the classes, I wish they were more consistently organized and worked together., We need more."
