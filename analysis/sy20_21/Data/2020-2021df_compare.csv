Creation of personal interest is vital to the output of students, so teachers must not see them as a number but as an individual. Everyone should be encouraged to find their place in learning and be able to admit their failures (teacher included). When students see that a teacher is immersed in the lesson and trying to draw students in with relative examples/materials, the students are more apt to open up and become part of the team of learning. Relationships are important to teenagers, and  teacher MUST not only acknowledge that but use it to the fullest extent., Success for all my students, My vision for my classroom is a technologically advanced learning environment that is also aesthetically please and offers a connection between comfort and the written word.

I would also like help with differentiation for diverse learners (students with disabilities and advanced learners), n/a, I will., I am a first year teacher and haven’t had the chance to get to know my coworkers due to corona, so some of my answers are a reflection of that and not of the school community., One of the question items on one of the earlier pages has ""(correct)"" appended to one of the multiple choice options...which seems like it maybe shouldn't be there?, None. Thank You., The first likert scale questions on this survey were trying to establish educators views on race and ethnicity when looking at our students. There is so much to discuss surrounding race and ethnicity that trying to gauge educators perspectives with so few questions will not give you the information you seek. Especially when one of those questions is through a “color blind” lens. This term has so much ambiguity that I am unsure about what each number on the scale would say about my ideals.   Also one of your questions has (correct) at the end of it signifying which answer is correct., Thank you!, Not at this time, None for now - Thank you!, Will I be privy to my diagnostic results indicating my shortcomings in an area?, This was an intense survey.  Many of the responses were vague.  For example, when discussing texts, the questions/responses were not specific.  Reading an excerpt versus reading a novel may allow teachers to implement varied teaching strategies.  In addition, some of the questions did not take into consideration the student population.  Teaching in an inclusive setting allows for the teachers to engage in varied teaching styles and therefore allowing wiggle room for teaching strategies.  The ""process"" may be different but the intended ""end results"" are attained., No questions at this time., The only comment was describing my location in the beginning of the survey, my school was not there. NYC District 11 p.s. 83, therefore, I click central office., OK., I am a new employee, so I haven't had the chance to build relationships and meet my coworkers in person which is indicative in some of my responses, ok, N/a, None at the moment ty, Ok, I am the SPED teacher for Inclusion. I am not a math content teacher., I do not at this time, na, Looking forward to working on the work!, I will, thank you., Some of the answer choices were written as absolutes.
